        <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the 
            CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible 
            black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
        <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Cold War
            </li>
            <li>
                The civil-rights movement
            </li>
            <li>
                the growth of the international drug trade
            </li>
        </ul>
